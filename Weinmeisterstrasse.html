<p>Three entries in, and I think we may already have a contender for ugliest/least interesting U-Bahn station. And that's coming from someone who loves baby blue... this station is not much to look at. It has a simple charm to it - its quiet and subdued, and honestly a bit soothing - but theres 173 of these bad boys, so that's just not gonna cut it. I'm perhaps a bit biased, as this U-Bahn station is in a part of Berlin that I don't particularly enjoy, but personal beef aside, this station is pretty uninspired.</p>

<p>That being said, this is our first encounter with Alfred Grenander, an important figure in the conversation of U-Bahn stations. That is my impression, at least, based on Weinmeisterstrasse's wikipedia article. This Swedish site engineer was responsible for the design of roughly 70 U-Bahn stations between 1902 and 1930, 52 of which I was able to identify on Wikipedia. Why the article claims he designed about 70 stations, but only lists 52, is beyond me. Perhaps some of those stations are gone now, perhaps he was not the sole designer of some of these 70 stations. I suspect we will answer this question on our journey. </p>

<p>Alfred Grenander, or Alfie, as I imagine he liked to be called, designed the first stations in the Art Nouveau, or neoclassical style. He eventually transitioned to a modern architecture, as can be seen in the Weinmeisterstrasse U-Bahn station. This station was one of 14 that he designed in 1930, the year before his death. Perhaps the fact that Alfie was on deaths door, and the fact that he was responsible for the design of a whopping 14 U-Bahn stations in the span of just 12 months, explains why the tiling scheme of the Weinmeissterstrasse U-Bahn station is so goddamn ugly.</p>
