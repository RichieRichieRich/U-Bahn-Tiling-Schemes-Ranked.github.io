<p>This station always sobers me up a bit. In a good way. The red is aggressive, a bit sexy. The panels differ in size and jut out wildly on the U7 platform - and form a slightly unconventional grid on the U9 platform. It feels very Berlin to me - very fitting, for U-Bahnhof Berliner Strasse. I read that when built in 1971, U-Bahnhof Berliner Strasse had the same color scheme, but made use of traditional tiles. It was only in 1999 that these tiles were replaced by enamel panels. Under ordinary circumstances, this would piss me off. That is the sort of thing that can only serve to make a station uglier. But in this case, I feel it works. It makes for a very dynamic U-Bahn station. Also, props for having different designs for the U7 and U9 platforms! I love that, Berlin taking initiative! </p>
