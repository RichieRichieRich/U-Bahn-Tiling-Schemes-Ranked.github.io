<p>It pains me to score Seestrasse so low, it really does. This is <em>my</em> station, you see. Any time I travel anywhere in Berlin, this is where I must go first; many of my days begin and end at the Seestrasse U-Bahnhof -- making it even more of a bummer that it is such a fucking eyesore. What it lacks in looks, however, it makes up for with a long, complicated, and boring history, chalk full of uninteresting trivia and boring bureaucratic nonsense.</p>

<p>Plans for the "North-south line", the line that U-Bahnhof Seestrasse originally belonged to, were conceived in 1902. The line was to run underneath Chausserstrasse and Friedrichstrasse, with a northern endpoint at the corner of Seestrasse/Müllerstrasse (where the Seestrasse station still stands today), and running southbound past Hallesches Tor towards a southern endpoint at Belle-Alliance-Strasse (Mehringdam) and Gneisenaustrasse. By 1912 construction had begun on sections of the North-South Line. Heinrich Jennin was put in charge of Seestrasse's design, but died before completing the station (quitter). A tragedy, of course, but this meant the project was picked up by our old friend Alfred "Alfie" Grenander. At the time 1917/1918 was the somewhat optimistic projected year of completion. No one could've guessed, of course, that a giant fly was about to land in the ointment: WWI. By the time the war was over,  stretches of the line were already complete, Seestrasse among them. In 1921 construction continued, and on March 8th, 1923, trains began running southbound from Seestrasse. In 1928 the North-south line was renamed to "Linie C" -- this name stuck until 1968, when it became the U6.   </p>

<p>The structural layout of the Seestrasse U-Bahnhof has always confused me. Today, the station has three total rails, two on either side of the westernmost platform, and one on the western side of the easternmost platform. The platforms are divided by a wall separating the middle rail -- belonging to the westernmost platform -- from the rail adjacent to the easternmost platform. The westernmost rail is only accessible from the western side of Müllerstrasse, and southbound trains to Alt-Mariendorf stop here. The central rail, to my knowledge, serves no purpose these days. The easternmost rail, for northbound trains towards K-Schumacher Platz, can only be accessed from the eastern side of Müllerstrasse. I suppose this is the thing that has always confused me: why are the platforms separated by a wall, and why do no trains ever seem to run on the central rail. Well, I learned from my research that upon completion, U-Bahnhof Seestrasse had a total of four rails (which may still be the case for all I know, the fourth rail could be hidden behind yet another wall). This was because the westernmost rails of each of the two platforms were responsible for "pendelverkehr", a shuttling system of sorts, between Seestrasse and the southern endpoint of the North-south line. In other words, trains that took people places stopped there. Meanwhile, the easternmost rails took trains to and from an above-ground maintenance station. This setup underwent a myriad of slight and uninteresting modifications in this stations 100 year history, including a brief stint as a WWII bomb shelter, but the original arrangement is likely to blame for the seemingly pointless middle rail. Mystery solved!</p>
