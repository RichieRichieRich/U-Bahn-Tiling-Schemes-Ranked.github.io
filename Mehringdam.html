<p>This station is completely and utterly devoid of charm. Not quite ugly enough to be camp, but certainly not interesting and/or beautiful enough to be nice to look at, Mehringdam is in limbo. This is, in many ways, fitting. Mehringdam is in the heart of Kreuzberg, it is here that the U6 and U7 lines, two essential lines in Berlin night-life, intersect. I have often found myself in limbo late at night at U-Bahnhof Mehringdam, with 15 minutes to kill until the next U6 towards K-Schumacher, and nothing to do but stare at the godawful tiling of Mehringdam U-Bahnhof.</p>

<p>Mehringdam was originally designed and built in 1924 by our old friend Alfred "Alfie" Grenander. Originally, it was named "Belle-Alliance-Strasse", and was renamed in 1947 to honor the historian, politician, and publicist, Franz Mehhring. Mehringdam was unique in that it employed a "dreischiffig", or three-aisled, architecture. Whereas all other U-Bahn stations at the time had a simple box-like shape, Mehringdam was almost church-like, with a central nave and aisles on either side to accomodate all three train rails. It was rebuilt in 1966. Unfortunately, there was no effort made to preserve the design of the original. A crying shame, because the art nouveau charm of the original was replaced with the complete lack of charm characteristic of something built in the 60's (I was unable to find photos of what it looked liked pre-remodeling, but I'll keep at it and add them as soon as I find something). It was again remodeled in 2008.</p>

<p>Mehringdam was originally designed with the punishment of Tempelhof (then an adjacent town, now a neighborhood in Berlin) in mind. Before WWI, when Berlin and Tempelhof were still separate townships growing side-by-side, the then government of Tempelhof bought the land that is now the Tempelhofer airfield. Berlin did not appreciate this. When Berlin was later responsible for the construction of the U-Bahn, the train line was designed to enter Mehringdam from the north, then take a sharp turn east towards Neuk√∂lln, thereby avoiding Tempelhof entirely. So, so petty, but I respect it. To this day, the stretch between Mehringdam and Gneisenaurstrasse, the next stop on the south-bound U7, is considered high risk. This is because of the sharp left turn and the relatively rapid incline over the course of the turn, the kind of design you would only make if you wanted to piss someone off. </p>
