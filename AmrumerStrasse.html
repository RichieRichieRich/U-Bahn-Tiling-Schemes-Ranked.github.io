<p>The Amrumer Strasse Wikipedia page is pretty sparse, much like the station itself. And that's not meant to be a diss. I enjoy the simplicity of the tiling -- glass panels with a slight teal hue, the name of the station printed directly on them, that classic U-Bahn font, over a dark blue background. It's understated and clean, with a calmness to it that I've come to associate with the U9. Pillars in the station are covered with small, similarly turquoise, tiles -- complementing the glass panels but not quite beating a dead teal horse, if that makes any sense. Construction was completed in 1961, and was lead by B. Grimmek. Yep. That's about it.</p>
