<p>Hallesches Tor is our first U-Bahn station with both an above-ground platform as well as a below-ground platform. It is not unique in this respect, however. There are a handful of U-Bahn stations in Berlin with both above-ground and below-ground platforms, and even a few that are exclusively above ground. Pretty counterintuitive -- I've always thought the U in U-Bahn referred to the underground nature of its stations. While this is likely true, the truth is that the U-Bahn network is really a series of different train lines, created independently of each other by various corporate and governmental entities, cobbled together over time. At some point, I'll get around to including a brief history of the U-Bahn on the landing page, which will hopefully clear up the more big picture stuff, but for now I'll just outline the relevant historical details here. </p>

<p>Hallesches Tor was one of the first U-Bahn stations. Construction was completed February 18, 1902 (side note: I'm writing this three days before its 120th birthday). It gets its name from Hallsches Tor (Halles Gate), the gate of the Berlin customs wall (1737 - 1860) leading towards Halle. Hallesches Tor originally played host to Linie 1 (what we know now as the U1), which ran towards Warschauer Strasse in the East, and Zoologischer Garten in the West. Hallesches Tor was designed by Hermann Solf and Franz Wichards, incorporating elements of the Neo-renaissance and Neo-baroque styles. Its construction was facilitated by the Hochbahngesellschaft, a subsidiary joint venture of Deutsche Bank and Siemens, formed in 1897 and liquidated in 1927.</p>

<p>An additional underground station was completed in 1923, built to service what was then the Linie C (1928 - 1966) and is now the U6. Unlike the above ground station, this new station was commissioned by the city of Berlin -- a tunnel was built between the two. Both stations were bombed to shit during the World War Two, and weren't fully operational again until 1949. In 1975/76 the below ground station was renovated to allow for longer trains; the previously boring white tiling was replaced with the beautiful sky blue enamel plates coupled with eye-catching red and white Hallesches Tor signs. Thats about all the history you need to know for this one.</p>

<p>You've probably gathered from its rating, and the previous paragraph, that I'm quite fond of the Hallesches Tor design. It's dynamic and exciting, it's colorful and vibrant, and it does all this while not being an obnoxious eye-sore. The sky blue of the enamel panelling clashes with the bright turnip red of the Hallesches Tor sign, but the result is a stunning contrast that pops -- a splash of color in Kreuzberg, it stands out on the U6. I have to transfer at Hallesches Tor to get to work, and have been saved many a time by these colors. Even if I'm looking down at my phone or a book, completely zoned out, the energetic tiling catches my eye and I know to get off. This is reflected in the "color" score. The typography is generic, but works  well here -- it's refreshing to have white lettering for a change. I gave extra points for the history of the station, and because I learned a lot about the history of Berlin while doing research. This was a fun U-Bahn station to write about.</p>
