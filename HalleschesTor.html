<p>Hallesches Tor is our first U-Bahn station with an above-ground platform, as well as a below-ground platform. It is not unique in this regard, however. There are a handful of U-Bahn stations in Berlin with both above-ground and below-ground platforms, and a couple that are exclusively above ground. Pretty counterintuitive, huh? I've always thought the U in U-Bahn referred to the underground nature of its stations. While this is likely true, the truth is that the U-Bahn network is really a series of different train lines, created independently of each other by various corporate and state-run entities, cobbled together over time. </p>
