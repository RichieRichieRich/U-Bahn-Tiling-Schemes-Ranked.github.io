<p>This is the first entry of the blog! I was wandering about in Moabit - hungry, tired, anxious, looking for a job - and ended up at Birkenstrasse. I had been turned away at many a cafe and restaurant, and it was getting dark and cold, and for some inexplicable reason this U-Bahn station spoke to me. It wanted to be ranked, it was asking, nay, begging, for it. At the time, I was blown away by its beauty, its warmth and tranquil. In retrospect (and this is reflected in Birkenstrasse's score) it is a pretty unremarkable U-Bahn station. I am all for teal/ light green, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and Birkenstrasse suffers from it. It is simply not that interesting of a color; its lovely in small doses but mediocre (at  best) in large quantities. Not quite enough pop to set it apart, but not quite subtle enough to act as a humble backdrop. Props for the tree arrangements, though. I assume they refer to the name of the station - Birkenstrasse means Birch street - but beyond that it is a very middle of the pack station. It will, however, always hold a special place in my heart, as the U-Bahn station that started it all :)</p>
